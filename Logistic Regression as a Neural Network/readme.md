# Understanding Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression

## 1. Forward Propagation:

- First, we predict the output \( A \) for a given input \( X \) using current parameters \( w \) and \( b \). This is done with the formula \( Z = w^T X + b \) and \( A = \text{sigmoid}(Z) \).
- Then, we compute the cost \( J \) using the formula for logistic regression's cost function. This cost represents how well (or poorly) the model's predictions \( A \) match the actual values \( Y \). The goal is to minimize this cost.

## 2. Backward Propagation:

- We compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. The gradients \( dw \) and \( db \) indicate the direction and magnitude of change required for each parameter to reduce the cost.
- The gradient \( dw \) is computed using the formula \( \frac{1}{m} X(A-Y)^T \) and \( db \) using \( \frac{1}{m} \sum(A-Y) \). Here, \( m \) is the number of training examples.

## 3. Gradient Descent:

- With the gradients computed, we update the parameters \( w \) and \( b \) in the direction that decreases the cost.
- The update rules are: 
    \( w = w - \alpha \times dw \)
    \( b = b - \alpha \times db \)
  where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate. This determines the step size in the gradient descent optimization. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm might overshoot the optimal value; if it's too small, convergence might be too slow.

## How does the cost guide the updates?

- The cost function measures the difference between the predictions of the model and the actual values. A higher cost indicates that the model's predictions are far from the actual values.
- The gradients \( dw \) and \( db \) indicate the direction and magnitude of changes required for each parameter to reduce this difference.
- By adjusting the parameters \( w \) and \( b \) in the direction of these gradients, the model attempts to reduce the cost in each iteration.
- Over multiple iterations, this process "guides" the parameters towards values that minimize the cost function, making the model's predictions closer to the actual values.

In conclusion, the cost provides feedback to the model about how "off" its predictions are, and the gradients provide the direction to adjust the parameters to improve these predictions. The process iterates until the cost converges to a minimum value (or until a set number of iterations).
