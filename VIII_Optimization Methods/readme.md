## First Moment (Mean of Gradients):

This gives us the average direction of the gradients over time. If the gradients are consistently pointing in a particular direction, the mean will capture this, and it will guide the parameter updates in that direction.
If the mean of the gradients is getting smaller, it suggests that we might be approaching a minimum (or maximum) since the slope (gradient) is reducing.

## Second Moment (Variance of Gradients):

The variance (or the squared gradients) captures how much the gradients are fluctuating. If the variance is high, it means the gradients are oscillating a lot, which can indicate a rough or bumpy loss surface.
By considering the variance, the optimizer can be more cautious with its updates in regions of high oscillation to prevent overshooting. In essence, if the variance of the gradients is high, the effective learning rate is reduced, leading to smaller updates. Conversely, in regions with low variance (consistent gradients), the optimizer can afford to take larger steps.
This adaptive learning rate mechanism helps in faster convergence and also in navigating the complex loss surfaces more effectively.
In summary:

The mean of the gradients (first moment) provides the direction for the update.
The variance of the gradients (second moment) helps in adaptively adjusting the magnitude of the update based on the consistency or variability of the gradients.
In the context of optimization algorithms like Adam, this combination allows the algorithm to be both directionally informed (by the mean) and cautious or bold (based on the variance), leading to efficient and stable convergence.
